# Flutter UI Demo

A new Flutter UI Challgence application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

I used free time to develop and learn dart with flutter framework for mobile apps development.
Hope to design the cool and awesome stuning UI. Right now most of UI I was learnt from existing mobile apps.
